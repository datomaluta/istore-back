#

### Getting Started

1\. First of all you need to clone repository from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/datomaluta/istore-back
```

2\. Next step requires you to run _composer install_ in order to install all the dependencies.

```sh
composer install
```

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#

**MYSQL:**

> DB_CONNECTION=mysql

> DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

> DB_PORT=3306

> DB_DATABASE=**\***

> DB_USERNAME=**\***

> DB_PASSWORD=**\***

in order to cache environment variables.

4\. Now execute in the root of you project following:

```sh
  php artisan key:generate
```

Which generates auth key.

##### Now, you should be good to go!
